## Overview

Build `RetryTransientMiddleware` from a `RetryPolicy`, then attach it to a
`reqwest_middleware::ClientBuilder`.
[`retry-policies::policies`](https://crates.io/crates/retry-policies) is reexported under
`reqwest_retry::policies` for convenience.

See [`reqwest_middleware`](https://docs.rs/reqwest_middleware) for usage with reqwest.
